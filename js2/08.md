# Create arrays using the proper syntax #8
** After each step, log the value or question/answer.**
1. Create an empty array

  `let emptyArray = [];`

2. Create an array containing the values `0`, `"one"`, `222`, `"gamma"`

  ```js
  let variableString = [0, "one", 222, "gamma"];
  console.log(variableString[2]); //222
  console.log(variableString[1]); //'one'
  ```
3. What is a sparse array and why should it be avoided?

 * A Sparse Array contain empty slots, you can notice one by seeing multiple commas being used inside an array. They should be avoided because they add confusion by adding an index but has no real value inside of it, and the true value of length is not accurate. Unless they have a real necessity, it is best to avoid them.
