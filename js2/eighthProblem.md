# Create arrays using the proper syntax #8
# After each step, log the value or question/answer.

## Create an empty array

`let emptyArray = [];`

## Create an array containing the values `0`, `"one"`, `222`, `"gamma"`

```
let variableString = [0, "one", 222, "gamma"];
variableString[2]; //222
variableString[1]; //'one'
```

## What is a sparse array and why should it be avoided?
 They should be avoided because they add confusion because the parse array adds a index but has no real value inside of it, and the true value of length is not accurate. Unless they have a real necessity, it is best to avoid them.
