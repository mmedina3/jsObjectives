## Development

This project includes an `.editorconfig` file. EditorConfig helps developers define and maintain consistent coding styles between different editors and IDEs. See [editorconfig.org](http://editorconfig.org) for details on how to configure your editor.

To install all dependencies:

```js
npm i
```

This repository uses [Mocha](https://mochajs.org/), a JavaScript test framework and [Istanbul](https://istanbul.js.org/) for code coverage.

To execute the test suite:
