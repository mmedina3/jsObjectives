# Store numbers and strings in variables #2

## Create and store the number 42 in a variable.

      let numStoring = 42;

## Create and store the word "forty-two" in a variable.

     let wordStoring = "forty-two";

## Are const index = '42'; and const index = 42; the same? Why or why not?

they are not the same because the first one is an interger(numbers) and the second is a string 42(letters).
